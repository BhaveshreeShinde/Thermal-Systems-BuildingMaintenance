          <p>
            Good commercial roof maintenance begins with annual roof inspection
            which provides you with the overall condition of the roof, as well
            as pointing out any areas of concern. Upon completion of the visual
            inspections, you are provided with a detailed report, complete with
            repair recommendations.
